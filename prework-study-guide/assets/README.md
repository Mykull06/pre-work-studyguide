## Description

My motivation for this project was to prepare myself as much as possible for the bootcamp.
To get a base understanding of coding as well as the tempo of the bootcamp.
This assists with me learing by providing a introduction to the course. 
I learned a lot about the 4 mentioned programming languages. I also have a novice understanding of how my code tells the computer what to do. Lastly I leared how to create a web page.
