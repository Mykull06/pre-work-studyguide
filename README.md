# <Pre-work-study-guide>

## Description

My motivation for this project was to prepare myself as much as possible for the bootcamp.
To get a base understanding of coding as well as the tempo of the bootcamp.
This assists with me learing by providing a introduction to the course. 
I learned a lot about the 4 mentioned programming languages. I also have a novice understanding of how my code tells the computer what to do. Lastly I leared how to create a web page.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
